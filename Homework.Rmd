It gives more value to students as it allows students to ask personalized questions. Below is an example of how to utilize ChatGPT to simplify learning for its users about “Game Theory”.
2.Decision Making and Problem Solving
ChatGPT serves as a valuable assistant for both math and coding assignments. It can guide students through complex problems by providing “step-by-step solutions” which help students understand the concepts better. When it comes to coding, ChatGPT assists in debugging, offers syntax recommendations for errors, and provides explanations for programming concepts. This capability ensures that learners have a reliable tool to navigate anywhere and anytime in case scheduling meetings with professors or tutors is not possible at a certain hour. It is one’s “24 X 7” helpline for homework assistance. Below is an example of debugging an error message from the python code to import files:
