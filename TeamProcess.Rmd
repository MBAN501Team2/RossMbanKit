#Team process
Happy Faces, Happy Team
When we took this picture, we did not know each other. Now we are told we have to work together for the next seven weeks building a website through RStudio and GitHub? How is that even possible? With teamwork, anything is possible. It started with taking lessons we learned each week in class and applying it to our team. The Professors stressed having psychological safety within a team, so we made sure to incorporate everyone's ideas during group meetings, give constructive feedback whenever possible, and make sure we kept our focus on a clear, common goal. 
Does Anyone Know How to Use RStudio or GitHub?
Using RStudio and GitHub to build this website was a challenging, but rewarding task. None of us had well-rounded experience in either, so how did we get here? We actually used ChatGPT! Refining prompts down to help us understand how to publish, edit, use Rmarkdown, and more. We combined our brains in order to figure out the most challenging task this semester. However, once we figured it out, it was rewarding as a team because it showed nothing is impossible for us. Throughout this project, we wanted to make sure we rewarded each other through achievments like presentations and our data gathering process.
Work Distribution
Dividing the work was actually easier than initially thought for us. We all had a passion for each section we wrote about. Matthew has a passion for storytelling and how we conducted our research. Pooja has a passion for career building, so she took the career planning section. Jie was focused on how ChatGPT can help students for homework so we assigned her that section. Jolene was conscious of ChatGPT's current ethical situations so she wrote about the controversy of ChatGPT. Lastly, Summer was very passionate about the well-being of her and other students at Ross so she took the well-being section. All in all, we knew we had to work together as a team to achieve this goal and distributing the work based on what we know we are good at helped make this project even better. 
Challenges
No group is perfect. We all had our challenges along the way with setting up meetings, making sure the meetings were productive, setting up GitHub, and much more. But, it is how we worked through those challenges to stick together towards our common goal. One class, we were provided with a survey of how our group members feel about how the group is performing. One member thought we could be doing a better job during meetings and making sure we all feel belonged. Instead of pushing back, we welcomed the feedback and worked together to make sure all of our future meetings were planned and stuck to our agenda.
