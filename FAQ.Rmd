#FQA
From the survey conducted, Students were asked to tell us about problems they would like Chat GPT to address. Of all the responses, the two questions that were frequently mentioned by our respondents were:
1.How can ChatGPT be more reliable and accurate for educational purposes?
2.How can ChatGPT be tailored to better support learning and academic needs?
Below are some tips students can use to personalize the AI chat box to meet their expectations:
1.Initial Information Gathering:
Using ChatGPT for getting a general idea of the topic you are exploring might be a better way to grasp understanding of a new topic. One can ask questions about the history, key concepts etc. After the basic information is gathered it can help us to brainstorm and check our sources from other websites.
Example: "Can you provide a brief overview of agile analytics?"
2.Clarification and Specification:
We commonly hear “Chat GPT provides generic information that is repetitive ''. One way to avoid getting generalized answers is getting specific with chat GPT. For example, you can use Chat GPT to summarize an article but it only gives you the basic information about the topic. To dive deep, you can ask chat GPT to elaborate on a specific sentence of the summary generated by chat GPT. This helps getting a more personalized answer. Also asking questions back and forth with chat gpt also helps us to understand the topic in detail. 
Example: "Can you talk more about agile and psychological safety and how it relates to teams?"
3.Step-by-Step Explanations:
If one is dealing with a technical problem, Chat GPT is a great tool to get step by step explanations of each function. For example, while working on python coding homework, you require help with understanding a particular function. You can ask chat gpt to provide you a step by step explanation and it will walk you through the whole process. For quick learning, this is one of the most efficient tools.
Example: “Give me a step by step explanation of combining datasets in python based on the date”
4.Ask Chat GPT for sources of the information it provides:
According to the article, “How can ChatGPT find reliable sources?”, ChatGPT provides information about the author and the source, and assesses the credibility of the source. The chatbox can also provide information about organizations that support the source.
Example: "Which websites can I refer to find data sets?"
